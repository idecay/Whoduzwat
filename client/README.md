# Project-4-Whoduzwat?

## Why Whoduzwat?

When a million things are happening at once it helps to have the tools available that make those things a little more managable. [Whoduzwat?](http://localhost:3000/home "Whoduzwat Homepage") aims to correct this issue by giving users a quick and easy tool for keeping track of who's turn it is to do what chore.
